Good day ladies, thank you for your participation in this project. I know that we'll do awesome 
as a group 👍😊

Firstly, I just want us to remember a few things, please remember to make a PULL request before you
start coding (if you've already connected the github code to your computer) and don't forget
to go back to github desktop to PUSH and COMMIT your code, VERY IMPORTANT.

Secondly, please if your task requires you creating a NEW HTML PAGE, please create a copy of the
SAMPLE.HTML file and rename your copy to suit whatever your task is and work with that. That page 
already contains a nav, header and footer with the theme of the website, so all you need to do is 
code in the white space which i marked as "<!-- YOUR CODE GOES HERE -->".

Lastly, let us follow the over all theme of the website by using appropriate colours and font size,
the main colour this theme uses is #54b9aa, #8acfc5, white, and so on. If you need to orient 
yourself with the theme of the template, then just explore the index.html page to see how the site
uses the different colours.

Remeber, if you are stuck or confused about ANYTHING, don't hesitate to ask someone, waiting too long 
will only use up the time we don't have. Google is your best friend, if you know what to do, but don'task
know how to do it, then ASK GOOGLE. 

All the best ladies ❤️😘😘
